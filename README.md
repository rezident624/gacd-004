####File 'run_analysis.R' contains two functions: createTidyData(directory) and createAverageTidyData(directory). They return tidy data that we need. Parameter 'directory' is the directory that contains path to extracted dataset, e.g. './getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset'. This scripts are independent and you can run it as you want.
